# Use an existing monad
During the last few iterations, a concept emerged from our code: `ConversionResult`.
It has evolved since it first appeared and now looks like a `monad`. 
Let's try to use the advantages of existing ones instead of having our own one.

In `C#`, we can use a library called [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext) that extends `C#` with a lot of functional programming oriented classes and features.

As a reminder, this is what our `ConversionResult` looks like at the moment:
```csharp
public class ConversionResult<T>
{
    public ConversionResult(Money money)
    {
        this.Money = money;
    }

    public ConversionResult(T failure)
    {
        this.Failure = failure;
    }

    public Money? Money { get; }

    public T? Failure { get; }

    public bool IsFailure() => this.Failure is { };

    public bool IsSuccess() => this.Money is { };

    public static ConversionResult<T> FromFailure(T failure) => new ConversionResult<T>(failure);

    public static ConversionResult<T> FromMoney(Money money) => new ConversionResult<T>(money);
}
```

## Which monad?
In `language-ext`, some useful monad types have already been defined.

![Available monads](img/LanguageExtMonads.png)

> Given the ConversionResult behavior, we are looking for a monad that can hold one of the 2 possible values: either a `success` or a `failure`.

- [`Option`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Monads/Alternative%20Value%20Monads/Option/Option/index.html) is a monadic container type which represents an optional value
  - Instances of Option are either an instance of `Some` or `None`
  - It cannot hold 2 different types of value
- [`Try`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Monads/Alternative%20Value%20Monads/Try/Try/index.html) is a monadic container type which represents a computation that may either result in an exception, or return a successfully computed value 
  - Instances of Try, are either an instance of `Success` or `Failure`
  - `It looks like a good candidate`
- [`Either`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Monads/Alternative%20Value%20Monads/Either/Either/index.html) represents a value of two possible types
  - An `Either` is either a Left or a Right
  - `Another good candidate`
- [`Validation`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Monads/Alternative%20Value%20Monads/Validation/index.html) is an applicative functor and facilitates accumulating errors
  - Not exactly what we're looking for at the moment 

The `Try` monad could be a good idea with notions of success/failure but it seems it won't fit.
We recently removed exceptions and our current monad return either a Money or a String. 

Finally, we decide to use the `Either` monad.

## Either monad
We start by adding the `LanguageExt.Core` package to our projects:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="LanguageExt.Core" Version="4.2.9" />
</ItemGroup>
```

As we rely a lot on `FluentAssertions`, we can also include `FluentAssertions.LanguageExt` to simplify the use of monads in our tests.
It means we won't have to extract values from monads in order to assert them.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="FluentAssertions.LanguageExt" Version="0.2.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Portfolio
:red_circle: You know the drill by now, new `TDD` cycle. As usual, we start with a red test on the `Portfolio`.

We are going to use a technique we used before, the `Strangler` pattern, to change a method signature without breaking our production code or our tests.

- We rename the current `Evaluate` method into `EvaluateWithConversionResult`
- We adapt a test to use the future `Evaluate` method with a signature like this: `Bank` -> `Currency` -> `Either<String, Money>`
  - By convention, `Left` is the failure case when using `Either`
- We use `FluentAssertions.LanguageExt`

```csharp
[Fact(DisplayName = "5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD")]
public void Add_ShouldAddMoneyInDollarAndEuro() =>
    PortfolioWith(5d.Dollars(), 10d.Euros())
        .Evaluate(this.bank, Currency.USD)
        .Should()
        .Be(17d.Dollars());
```

It's not eye-popping but `FluentAssertions.LanguageExt` is really helpful here. 
`Evaluate` returns an `Either<string, Money>` and, thanks to the library, `.Should().Be(...)` will assert on the left or right part of the monad depending on the object we pass. 
`string` will evaluate the left part while `Money` will evaluate the right part.


Then, we generate the new method from the test:

```csharp
public Either<string, Money> Evaluate(Bank bank, Currency usd)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}

public ConversionResult<string> EvaluateWithConversionResult(Bank bank, Currency currency)
{
    var results = this.GetConvertedMoneys(bank, currency);
    return ContainsFailure(results)
        ? ConversionResult<string>.FromFailure(this.ToFailure(results))
        : ConversionResult<string>.FromMoney(this.ToSuccess(results, currency));
}
```

:green_circle: We implement the method using the old one by using `Left()` and `Right()` methods from `Either`.

```csharp
public Either<string, Money> Evaluate(Bank bank, Currency currency)
{
    var result = this.EvaluateWithConversionResult(bank, currency);
    return result.IsFailure()
        ? Either<string, Money>.Left(result.Failure!)
        : Either<string, Money>.Right(result.Money!);
}
```

:large_blue_circle: Refactor time!
We can now put the logic from `EvaluateWithConversionResult` into `Evaluate` and verify if our tests still pass.

```csharp
public Either<string, Money> Evaluate(Bank bank, Currency currency)
{
    var results = this.GetConvertedMoneys(bank, currency);
    return ContainsFailure(results)
        ? Either<string, Money>.Left(this.ToFailure(results))
        : Either<string, Money>.Right(this.ToSuccess(results, currency));
}
```

`Evaluate` is now independent from `EvaluateWithConversionResult`.

:large_blue_circle: We can now decommission `EvaluateWithConversionResult` by calling `Evaluate` from our tests.

```csharp
[Fact(DisplayName = "1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW")]
public void Add_ShouldAddMoneyInDollarAndKoreanWons() =>
    PortfolioWith(1d.Dollars(), 1100d.KoreanWons())
        .Evaluate(this.bank, Currency.KRW)
        .Should()
        .Be(2200d.KoreanWons());

[Fact(DisplayName = "5 USD + 10 EUR + 4 EUR = 21.8 USD")]
public void Add_ShouldAddMoneyInDollarsAndMultipleAmountInEuros() =>
    PortfolioWith(5d.Dollars(), 10d.Euros(), 4d.Euros())
        .Evaluate(bank, Currency.USD)
        .Should()
        .Be(21.8.Dollars());

[Fact(DisplayName = "Throws a MissingExchangeRatesException in case of missing exchange rates")]
public void Add_ShouldThrowAMissingExchangeRatesException()
{
    PortfolioWith(1d.Euros(), 1d.Dollars(), 1d.KoreanWons())
        .Evaluate(this.bank, Currency.EUR)
        .Should()
        .Be("Missing exchange rate(s): [USD->EUR],[KRW->EUR]");
}

[Fact(DisplayName = "5 USD + 10 USD = 15 USD")]
public void Add_ShouldAddMoneyInTheSameCurrency() =>
    PortfolioWith(5d.Dollars(), 10d.Dollars())
        .Evaluate(bank, Currency.USD)
        .Should()
        .Be(15d.Dollars());
```

Finally, `EvaluateWithConversionResult` is now considered `dead code` and we can safely remove it safely.

Another refactoring done right with `TDD`!

### Bank
Let's do the same at the `Bank` level

:red_circle: We adapt an existing test.

```csharp
[Fact(DisplayName = "10 EUR -> USD = 12 USD")]
public void ConvertEuroToUsd() =>
    _bank.ConvertWithConversionResult(10d.Euros(), USD)
        .Money
        .Should()
        .Be(12d.Dollars());
```

Then we generate our new method from it.

```csharp
public class Bank
{ 
    public Either<string, Money> Convert(Money money, Currency currency)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    
    public ConversionResult<string> ConvertWithConversionResult(Money money, Currency to) =>
              this.CanConvert(money.Currency, to)
                  ? ConversionResult<string>.FromMoney(ConvertSafely(money, to))
                  : ConversionResult<string>.FromFailure($"{money.Currency}->{to}");
}

public class BankShould
{     
    [Fact(DisplayName = "10 EUR -> USD = 12 USD")]
    public void ConvertEuroToUsd() =>
        _bank.Convert(10d.Euros(), USD)
            .Should()
            .Be(12d.Dollars());
}
```

:green_circle: Same step than before. 
We implement the method by calling `ConvertWithConversionResult`.

```csharp
public Either<string, Money> Convert(Money money, Currency currency)
{
    var result = this.ConvertWithConversionResult(money, currency);
    return result.IsFailure()
        ? Either<string, Money>.Left(result.Failure!)
        : Either<string, Money>.Right(result.Money!);
}
```

:large_blue_circle: Refactor time!
We can now put the logic from `ConvertWithConversionResult` into `Convert` and verify if our tests still pass.

```csharp
public Either<string, Money> Convert(Money money, Currency currency) =>
    this.CanConvert(money.Currency, currency)
        ? Either<string, Money>.Right(this.ConvertSafely(money, currency))
        : Either<string, Money>.Left($"{money.Currency}->{currency}");
```

`Convert` is now independent from `ConvertWithConversionResult`.

:large_blue_circle: We can now decommission `ConvertWithConversionResult` by calling `Convert` from our tests.

```csharp
[Fact(DisplayName = "10 EUR -> EUR = 10 EUR")]
public void ConvertMoneyInSameCurrency() =>
    _bank.Convert(10d.Euros(), EUR)
        .Should()
        .Be(10d.Euros());

[Fact(DisplayName = "Throws a MissingExchangeRateException in case of missing exchange rates")]
public void ReturnsFailureResultGivenMissingExchangeRate() =>
    this._bank.Convert(10d.Euros(), KRW)
        .Should()
        .Be("EUR->KRW");

[Fact(DisplayName = "Conversion with different exchange rates EUR -> USD")]
public void ConvertWithDifferentExchangeRates()
{
    _bank.Convert(10d.Euros(), USD)
        .Should()
        .Be(12d.Dollars());

    _bank.AddExchangeRate(EUR, USD, 1.3)
        .Convert(10d.Euros(), USD)
        .Should()
        .Be(13d.Dollars());
}
```

Unfortunately, we have one more step to go.
`ConvertWithConversionResult` is still used in `GetConvertedMoneys` from `Portfolio`.

```csharp
private List<ConversionResult<string>> GetConvertedMoneys(Bank bank, Currency currency) =>
    this.moneys
        .Select(money => bank.ConvertWithConversionResult(money, currency))
        .ToList();
```
We can remove the use from the old method by converting the result back to a `ConversionResult`:

```csharp
private List<ConversionResult<string>> GetConvertedMoneys(Bank bank, Currency currency) =>
    this.moneys
        .Select(money => bank.Convert(money, currency))
        .Select(monad => monad.Match(money => new ConversionResult<string>(money), failure => new ConversionResult<string>(failure)))
        .ToList();
```

Finally, `ConvertWithConversionResult` is now considered `dead code` and we can safely remove it safely.

### Portfolio refactoring
We were able to remove `ConvertWithConversionResult` and finish our refactoring. But it leads us to another one: we need to remove every use of `ConversionResult` in the Portfolio. 

We can't use the same technique anymore.
Indeed, we can't use a test as driver here because none of these methods are exposed. 
They're all internals to `Portfolio`, only `Evaluate` is available.  

:large_blue_circle: Then, let's use our compiler errors as a refactoring driver. We use `GetConvertedMoneys` as starting point and make it return an `Either<>`.

![Compiler errors as driver](img/MonadRefactoring.png)

The refactoring is easier than it seems. Here's what it looks like:
```csharp
private static bool ContainsFailure(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> results) =>
        results.Any(result => result.IsLeft);

private List<Either<string, Money>> GetConvertedMoneys(Bank bank, Currency currency) =>
    this.moneys
        .Select(money => bank.Convert(money, currency))
        .ToList();

public Portfolio Add(Money money)
{
    List<Money> updatedMoneys = this.moneys.ToList();
    updatedMoneys.Add(money);
    return new Portfolio(updatedMoneys);
}

private static string GetMissingRates(IEnumerable<string> missingRates) => missingRates
    .Select(value => $"[{value}]")
    .Aggregate((r1, r2) => $"{r1},{r2}");

private string ToFailure(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> results) =>
    $"Missing exchange rate(s): {GetMissingRates(results.Where(result => result.IsLeft).Select(result => result.IfRight(string.Empty)))}";

private Money ToSuccess(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> results, Currency currency) =>
    new(results.Where(result => result.IsRight).Sum(result => result.IfLeft(new Money(0, currency)).Amount), currency);

public Either<string, Money> Evaluate(Bank bank, Currency currency)
{
    var results = this.GetConvertedMoneys(bank, currency);
    return ContainsFailure(results)
        ? Either<string, Money>.Left(this.ToFailure(results))
        : Either<string, Money>.Right(this.ToSuccess(results, currency));
}
```

An important thing you may have realized: we are using `IfLeft()` and `IfRight()`. 
Even if we filter to have only failures or only moneys, the library does not trust us. We need to provide a default value in case the monad contains the other value.

For example:
```csharp
Either<string, Money> monad = ...
Money result = monad.IfLeft(new Money(0, Currency.Eur));
// result will contain:
// - new Money(0, Currency.Eur) if the monad contains a string
// - the monad value if the monad contains a money
```

:large_blue_circle: By providing a default value, we directly used the `Money` constructor.
We would like to give it a better meaning.

```csharp
private Money ToSuccess(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> results, Currency currency) =>
    new(results.Where(result => result.IsRight).Sum(result => result.IfLeft(Money.Empty(currency)).Amount), currency);
    
public record Money(double Amount, Currency Currency)
{
    public static Money Empty(Currency currency) => new Money(default, currency);
}
```

:large_blue_circle: We were able to remove all use from `ConversionResult`. So let's safely remove it.

## Use immutable collections
:large_blue_circle: Let's use the advantages of `LanguageExt` to simplify our code

It comes with a large variety of immutable collections and functions that we can use to simplify our code. You can check them [here](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext#immutable-collections).

### Bank
:red_circle: We start by using `Map<>` in order to replace `ReadOnlyDictionary<>`.
Like we did before, we cannot start from a red test here as the dictionary is internal to the Bank. 
We have to use again a compilation error as a driver.

```csharp
public sealed class Bank
{
    private readonly Map<string, double> _exchangeRates;

    private Bank(Map<string, double> exchangeRates) => _exchangeRates = new Map<string, double>(exchangeRates);
}
```

:green_circle: We have to adapt other methods to come back in the green state.
Especially in the `AddExchangeRate` method, we can benefit from pure functions from `Map<>` as every method returns a new instance of`Map<>`. 

```csharp
public sealed class Bank
{
    private readonly Map<string, double> _exchangeRates;

    private Bank(Map<string, double> exchangeRates) => this._exchangeRates = new Map<string, double>(exchangeRates);

    public static Bank WithExchangeRate(Currency from, Currency to, double rate) => 
        new Bank(new Map<string, double>()).AddExchangeRate(from, to, rate);

    public Bank AddExchangeRate(Currency from, Currency to, double rate) =>
            new Bank(new Map<string, double>(this._exchangeRates).AddOrUpdate(KeyFor(from, to), rate));
    
    ...
    
    // We use Find method allowing us to get the result safely as an Option monad, and provide a default value if not found
    private Money ConvertSafely(Money money, Currency to) =>
        to == money.Currency
            ? money
            : money with { Amount = money.Amount * this._exchangeRates.Find(KeyFor(money.Currency, to)).IfNone(0), Currency = to};
}
```

### Portfolio
:red_circle: We start by using `Seq<>` in order to replace `ICollection<>`.

```csharp
public class Portfolio
{
    private readonly Seq<Money> moneys;

    public Portfolio() => this.moneys = Seq<Money>.Empty;

    private Portfolio(Seq<Money> moneys) => this.moneys = moneys;
}
```

:green_circle: Again, we need to adapt one method to come back to the green state.

```csharp
public class Portfolio
{
    public Portfolio Add(Money money) => new Portfolio(this.moneys.Add(money));
}
```

We take advantage of this refactoring to reorganise the methods so that they can be read in their order of usage.

## Reflect
- What do you think about those concepts and this library?
- What could you do with it?

![Monads by example](../../docs/img/monad.png)

## Bonus

A few steps ago, we introduced the concept of [Mutation Testing](1-mutation-testing.md). This process can take quite some time so we can't really count on it for our fast-feedback loop. A better idea is to integrate it in a pipeline or run it periodically.

Let's run it again, just to make sure we still have a 100% mutation score.

Uh-oh...

```
100,00% │ Testing mutant 17 / 17 │ K 16 │ S 1 │ T 0 │ ~0m 00s │
Killed:   16
Survived:  1
Timeout:   0
Time Elapsed 00:00:19.2866728
The final mutation score is 94.12 %
```

A mutant has survived so let's look at the report to see what it's about.

![Mutant](img/LanguageExtMutant.png)

Stryker as mutated the value in `.IfRight` and the test still passes. This method is never called as we filter the list on Failures only.

It brings an interesting point: we're trying to extract the value from the monad (`Either<>`) **too early**.

:large_blue_circle: Let's refactor and kill the mutant. It will be easy given our current test suite.

The idea is to get the value from `Either<>` only when we need it with a `.Match()` method on the collection. The collection is changed from a `IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>>` to an `IEnumerable<string>`.

```csharp
private string ToFailure(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> results) =>
    $"Missing exchange rate(s): {GetMissingRates(results)}";

private static string GetMissingRates(IEnumerable<Either<string, Money>> missingRates) => missingRates
    .Match(money => string.Empty, failure => $"[{failure}]")
    .Where(message => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(message))
    .Aggregate((r1, r2) => $"{r1},{r2}");
```

All our tests are passing. We can run the mutation report again to verify we killed the mutant.

```
100,00% │ Testing mutant 18 / 18 │ K 18 │ S 0 │ T 0 │ ~0m 00s │
Killed:   18
Survived:  0
Timeout:   0
Time Elapsed 00:00:21.0626918
The final mutation score is 100.00 %
```

We are back to **100%** mutation score. As you can see, running mutation testing once in a while is still useful to keep control on the codebase while it evolves (even when applying TDD).
