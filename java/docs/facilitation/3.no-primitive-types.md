## 3.No Primitive Types
- Introduce Money concept
  - A concept emerge from the code
      - A `Money` concept which is not cohesive with behavior in the `MoneyCalculator`
- Introduce Parameter Object from `MoneyCalculator`
    - You can use `Introduce Parameter Object` from your IDE
    - Let's adapt the `divide` as well
- Now that we have a dedicated concept for our money operations we can move methods from `MoneyCalculator` to `Money`
    - We can use `Move Members` feature from our IDE
- Then configure the refactoring `move to` `Money`
- We can refactor the `Money` to return `Money` objects from methods and no more `double`
    - Here we can use `isEqualTo` method to assert the result because we used `record` class for `Money`
    - It uses value equality and no reference equality

```java
class MoneyCalculatorTest {
    @Test
    @DisplayName("10 EUR x 2 = 20 EUR")
    void shouldMultiplyInEuros() {
        assertThat(Money.times(new Money(10, EUR), 2))
                .isEqualTo(new Money(20, EUR));
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW")
    void shouldDivideInKoreanWons() {
        assertThat(Money.divide(new Money(4002, KRW), 4))
                .isEqualTo(new Money(1000.5, KRW));
    }
}
```

- Clean our code
    - Delete `MoneyCalculator`
    - Rename `MoneyCalculatorTest` to `MoneyTest`
    - Make methods non static in `Money`
        - Adapt the tests as well

### Adapt the Portfolio
- Adapt an existing test
- Generate a new `add` method from the test taking `Money` as parameter
- Our test is now red
    - Let's make it green by plug-in the new `add` method to the existing one
    - Our test is now green -> let's refactor our code
- Change the `add(Money money)` to add `Money` to a private List
  - Plug the existing `add` method to the new one
  - Change the loop from the `evaluate` method to use the `moneys` List
- Let's adapt the `PortfolioTest` to only use the new `add` method
- We can now remove the former `add` method from our `Portfolio`

- We need to change the signature of the `evaluate` method as well
    - its signature should be `Bank -> Currency -> Money` to ensure we don't return primitive types anymore
- Adapt a first test that will guide us
  - Our test is now green
  - Others are failing, we need to adapt assertions accordingly

> During `Portfolio` refactoring to use `Money` type, we have "discovered" that we need to adapt our `Bank` as well to return `Money` from `convert`

### Adapt the Bank
- We can apply the same strategy as on the `Portfolio`
    - Adapt an existing test
    - Generate code from usage and then make the test pass
    - Then refactor
    - Apply to other tests
- Adapt the `Portfolio` as well

### Reflect
- During this iteration we have introduced a new Business concept `Money` and adapted our code accordingly to manipulate more meaningful concepts from our domain.
- In the meantime, by making the refactoring we have seen duplication everywhere in our tests regarding `Money` instantiation
    - If the constructor of this object changes at one point it will have a huge impact on our tests
    - We want to avoid this situation so let's make something on it

- In java, we do not have extension methods yet
    - Let's create a `Utility` class allowing us to write our tests like this :
    
```java
assertThat(euros(10)
    .times(2))
    .isEqualTo(euros(20));
```
