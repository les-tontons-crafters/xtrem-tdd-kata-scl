## 5.Only Immutable Types
- Let's identify mutable types : `Bank`, `Portfolio`

### Bank
- What we want to achieve by making it immutable is to have a method `addExchangeRate` with a signature like this `Currency` -> `Currency` -> `double` -> `Bank`
- Let's start by adapting a test to make it `red`
  - Make it `green`
- Now we can refactor
    - Let's simplify our test
- Let's make it impossible to mutate accidentally our `exchangeRates` from the `Bank`
    - We can force it by using `Collections.unmodifiableMap` from the private constructor
- We had an impact on `Portflio` tests by doing it and need to adapt the test code as well
    - Now that `Bank` is immutable we need to change the private field instantiation

### Portfolio
- Regarding the `add` method, it is used a lot of time, so we need to have a different refactoring strategy
- Rename the existing method to `addOld`
- Adapt a test to have a red test that will call the new method
- Generate the new `add` method from test
    - Call the old method from the new one
- Now we can refactor
    - We add a private constructor
    - And need to define a public one as well
- Now out test is green
- Let's refactor our test to make it simple to instantiate `Portfolio`
    - We encapsulate `Portfolio` instantiation in a dedicated method taking n Moneys as args

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("5 USD + 10 USD = 15 USD")
void shouldAddMoneyInTheSameCurrency() throws MissingExchangeRatesException {
    var portfolio = portfolioWith(
            dollars(5),
            dollars(10)
    );

    assertThat(portfolio.evaluate(bank, USD))
            .isEqualTo(dollars(15));
}

private Portfolio portfolioWith(Money... moneys) {
    return Arrays.stream(moneys)
            .reduce(new Portfolio(), Portfolio::add, (previousPortfolio, newPortfolio) -> newPortfolio);
}
```

- Let's plug remaining tests to the new `add` method
- We can safely delete the `addOld` method
