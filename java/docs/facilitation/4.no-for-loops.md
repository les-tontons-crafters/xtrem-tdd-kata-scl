## 4.No For Loops
- We can refactor this by using `stream api`
    - It will allow us to remove mutable variables

> We can safely refactor because our code has been designed using TDD -> we have a high coverage as a side effect (safety net for refactoring)

- First step : use a foreach
  - We still use a `double` to sum our `Money` so we need to use an `AtomicReference<Double>`
- Second step : remove mutation
  - To remove the `mutation` we need to think about how to sum our conversionResult from the `Bank`
  - We start by implementing a new method `convertMoney` that returns a `ConversionResult`
      - This type will encapsulate the fact that conversion can success (contains a Money) or fail (throws an exception)

```java
private ConversionResult convertMoney(Bank bank, Money money, Currency toCurrency) {
    try {
        return new ConversionResult(bank.convert(money, toCurrency));
    } catch (MissingExchangeRateException missingExchangeRateException) {
        return new ConversionResult(missingExchangeRateException);
    }
}

private record ConversionResult(Money money, MissingExchangeRateException missingExchangeRateException) {
    public ConversionResult(Money money) {
        this(money, null);
    }

    public ConversionResult(MissingExchangeRateException missingExchangeRateException) {
        this(null, missingExchangeRateException);
    }
}
```

- Let's use it in our `evaluate`
    - We start by converting all the moneys
- Then we need to check if we have any conversion errors aka `MissingExchangeRateException`
    - We add a method on `ConversionResult` to make it explicit
- Our tests are still green, here is the code all together
- What can be improved ?
    - Simplify the `evaluate` method by extracting `private` methods with explicit names
