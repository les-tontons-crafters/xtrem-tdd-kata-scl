## Let's mutate some code
### Discover the Code
Take a few minutes to discover the source code (production and related tests).

### Code Coverage
Run a `code coverage` analysis and discuss regarding the result.

> Would you be confident to refactor the production code with such coverage?

### Mutation Testing
Take some time to discover the concept behind [Mutation Testing](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/mutation-testing)
- What did you learn from this page?
- Implement what is mandatory in your language to run a `mutant analysis`
- Analyze the resulting report

> What did you learn from this report?

### Kill the Mutants
Fix the tests to kill the mutants that have been identified.

> Would you be more confident to refactor the production code now? 

### Our Advice
`Always focus on good assertions when writing tests`.

Take a look at the [Test Desiderata](https://kentbeck.github.io/TestDesiderata/) if you want to know more.

Here mutants have been identified because the code has not been written using `TDD` and systematic refactoring.
