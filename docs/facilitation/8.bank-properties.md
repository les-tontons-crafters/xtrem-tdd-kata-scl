## Property-Based Testing to challenge our Domain Model

As usual, take some time to read about [Property-Based Testing](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/pbt).

### The Problem
- We have worked closely with our domain experts and at one point we spotted a problem together with the exchange rates

| From | To   | Rate    |
|------|------|---------|
| EUR  | USD  | 1.2     |
| USD  | EUR  | 0.82    |
| USD  | KRW  | 1100    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.0009  |
| EUR  | KRW  | 1344    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.00073 |

- We have 2 times a line for `KRW` to `EUR`
- We discussed with our experts, and they explain to us that they have `simply` written the wrong destination currency (To) on line 4 (Apparently, it can often happens...)
    
After a fix, the table now looks like this:

| From | To  | Rate    |
|------|-----|---------|
| EUR  | USD | 1.2     |
| USD  | EUR | 0.82    |
| USD  | KRW | 1100    |
| KRW  | USD | 0.0009  |
| EUR  | KRW | 1344    |
| KRW  | EUR | 0.00073 |

- We are not fully confident in this table that will be at the center of our system
    - We discuss again with our experts on a way to enforce this table coherence/consistency
    - The conclusion is that we can easily improve it by checking what they call `Round-Tripping`
    - `from(to(x)) == x`

In other terms

```gherkin
Given an original amount in currency A
When we convert it to currency B and convert it back to currency A
Then we should receive the original amount 
```

### Property-Based Testing
Use `Property-Based Testing` to check `Round-Tripping` property. 
It could help us better understand the business and discover edge cases.

### Reflect
- What did you discover about the Bank and our entire Domain Model thanks to PBT?
- What could be a better way to handle exchange rates in our system?
