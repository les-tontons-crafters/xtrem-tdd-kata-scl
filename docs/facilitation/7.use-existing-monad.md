## Use an existing monad
To remove exceptions, a concept emerged from our code: `ConversionResult`.
This type looks like a monad. 

As usual, take some time to read about [Monads](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/monads).

Instead of defining our own type let's try to use the advantages of existing ones:
- In `java`: use [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/)
- In `C#`: use [Language-Ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext)
- In `scala`: use the ones from the language itself

Choose a `monadic container` from the library and refactor to it using `TDD`.

You should be able to delete `ConversionResult` class at the end.

### Reflect
> What do you think about those concepts and this library? What could you do with it?
