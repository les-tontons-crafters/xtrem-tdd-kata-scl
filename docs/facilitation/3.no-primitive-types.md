## Fight Primitive Obsession
Take some time to read the page dedicated to [No Primitive Types](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/no-primitive-types)

> Which cohesive concept emerges from the code?

### Introduce Money concept
Fight Primitive Obsession by introducing this `Money` concept from the tests using as always `TDD`.
Start from the `Money` calculation then adapt the `Portfolio` and the `Bank` to use this new `Domain Entity`.

Always have a red test as a `driver`.

### Improvement?
We use a lot the `Money` constructor from our tests.

It makes them fragile to refactoring. We may use another way of instantiating them from our tests.

Create extension methods to  simplify `Money` instantiation everywhere.
